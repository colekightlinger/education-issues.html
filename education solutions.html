<h1>National solution: Syria</h1>
<p>The UN and Syria would try to stop the civil war so that the rest of the process could continue. Next would be a fundraiser<br>
from the UN and Syria to raise money for and educational program for the entire country. Last Syria would use the money to build<br>
more schools and give each a portion of the money to run the schools and pay for the teachers. </p>

  
  <h1>Global solution</h1>
  <p>First war and terrorism would have to be halted. Next The UN would raise money for education purposes. And last the money<br>
