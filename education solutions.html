<h1>National solution: Syria</h1>
<p>The UN and Syria would try to stop the civil war so that the rest of the process could continue. Next would be a fundraiser<br>
from the UN and Syria to raise money for and educational program for the entire country. Last Syria would use the money to build<br>
more schools and give each a portion of the money to run the schools and pay for the teachers. Some challenges are that there is<br>
a very small possibility that the Sirian civil war will end soon and the entire plan hinges on that war stopping. My solution will<br>
positively affect the problem by getting the 3 or so million children out of school will be allowed to start/continue their education<br>
in their own country instead of a foriegn country where they don't know the language. This next generation of children will help<br>
prevent another war from breaking out and ruining their children's lives.</p>

  
  <h1>Global solution</h1>
  <p>First war and terrorism would have to be halted. Next The UN would raise money for education purposes. And last the money<br>
  would go to building schools and raising teachers wages so that they actually want to teach children. Althogh one part of my solution<br>
  has been tried before and that was raisng money for education. The problem was that this was a temporary solution for few.A few problems<br>
  are wars are always happening and there's a very small chance that The UN could convince terrorists to stop so that children could learn.<br>
  It is doubtfull that The UN would be able to raise enough money for all the children of the world. The countries might not agree<br>
  because not all countries are in the United Nations. The reason why my solution is good is because it will prevent war and extremist<br>
  groups from attempting to take girls or other children out of schools. The money raised would help families even in poverty to send<br>
  their children to school. The schools and increased teacher wages would give every child a fair chance at a bright future through education.</p>
