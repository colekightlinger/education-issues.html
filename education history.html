    <h2>history paragraph</h2>
    <p>The problem is war and how it causes hunger; it relates to sustainability because we need food to survive and for society<br>
    to thrive, and if even a small portion of us are denied of this, it can have catastrophic effects on our future as a species.<br>
    In Syria the problems started after WW2 when the decolonization process. The French colony of Syria was made one country which<br>
    had never been a country unless they had a strong foreign government to rule them. This caused ethnic and religious problems<br>
    and even tribal feuds. Which causes war and that causes hunger. Recently the “mother of all bombs” or MOAB was dropped near one<br>
    of our main countries, Syria. It was done in response to a gas attack that killed and injured many civilians. This is an example<br>
    of how countries that mean well and try to provide a solution do the opposite by hitting things that are vital for who they are<br>
    trying to help. This is still a problem today because all of the wars we have talked about are still going on. The amount of<br>
    malnourished people in these war torn countries is growing. Aid is being blocked both by conflict and increasingly insufficient<br>
    infrastructure. Food supplies are being destroyed by attempts to help that do the opposite. War causing hunger is a problem that<br>
    can be fixed and rectified by cooperation between countries and compliance within the affected groups.  With this type of<br>
    cooperation, we can create sustainable society’s, environments, and Economies that will serve the next generations well.</p>
