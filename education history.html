    <h2>history paragraph</h2>
    <p>The problem I will discuss is education, for a long time children and girls have been missing parts or their whole<br>
    education. The earliest education became a problem in my countries was 2006 when 20 million children were out of school<br>
    in Pakistan. Then came Syria with its civil war forcing 3 million children out of school. Recently in Pakistan the Taliban<br>
    have been forcing girls out of school. In Mali 100,000â€™s of children have their education at a stand still because around<br>
    1,500 schools are being damaged or destroyed and are in need of repair. In The Central African Republic 1.2 million children<br>
    need emergency aid because of a power exchange. In The Central African Republic the Seleka coalition has taken control from<br>
    the government and this halted the education of many. In Syria their civil war still rages and is preventing millions of<br>
    children from going to school. In Pakistan the Taliban are still preventing girls from going to school but they have conceded<br>
    a little by allowing girls 10 and under to go to school. The problem of children and girls not being allowed or unable to<br>
    go to school needs to be solved quickly if this world is to be fixed. Mankind needs all the help it can get to try and leave<br>
    earth survivable for future generations and to keep it from becoming a wasteland from having all of its natural resources<br>
    being used up.</p>
