  <h1>Stakeholders</h1>
  <p>Stakeholding groups: The UN. Department of International Development.<br>
  Perspectives on issue:The UN's perspective:In 2000 164 countries agreed to make education available for all. They have been<br>
  trying to solve the problem of education since then. They are affected by the loss of education for their children and the<br>
  next generation. The DFID's perspective: They wish to get an equal amount of girls into school as boys. They wish to solve<br>
  the issue so their will be less gender inequality.<br>
  Addressing the issue:The UN's address on education: They have increased primary school enrollment worldwide and the number<br>
  of out of school children decreased by about 13 million between 1999 and 2009. Positive affects of this could stop so many<br>
  young people from dropping out of school early. Negative affects could be the amount of money spent to improve education.<br>
  It could make several countries go broke. The DFID's address on education: They plan to improve education and the<br>
  availability of education in 25 or more countries around the world.</p>
